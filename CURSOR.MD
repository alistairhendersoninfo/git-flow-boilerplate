## File Organization

### Project Documentation (for users):
- Root `.md` files - Project overview, installation, usage
- `docs/` directory - Technical documentation and guides
- `README.md` - Main project documentation

### AI Assistant Instructions (for Claude behavior):
- `.claude/` directory contains AI assistant behavioral instructions
- Always read relevant `.claude/*.md` files for context
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Current permission settings

**IMPORTANT**: Files in `.claude/` are AI assistant instructions, not project documentation.

## Permissions & Settings

**‚ö†Ô∏è Read `.claude/settings.local.json` to understand current permission mode.**

### Permission System:
- **`allow`** - Commands Claude can execute freely
- **`ask`** - Commands that require user permission first
- **`deny`** - Commands that are completely blocked

### Template Modes:
```markdown
## Current Mode: [Safe Template / Local Installation Template]

### Safe Template (Development with Remote Installation)
- **Purpose**: Prevent local server modification
- **Allows**: git, gh, python, file operations, basic bash
- **Asks**: Destructive commands (rm -rf, git reset --hard)
- **Denies**: Installation commands (apt, npm install, make install)
- **Best for**: Projects using MCP servers for remote operations

### Local Installation Template  
- **Purpose**: Full local development capabilities
- **Allows**: Installation (apt install, make, cmake, cargo build)
- **Asks**: System-level destructive operations
- **Denies**: Network operations (ssh, curl, git push, docker push)
- **Best for**: Local development and compilation projects
```

### Key Commands by Permission:
```markdown
## Allowed Commands (Execute Freely):
- [List key commands that are always allowed]
- git status, git add, git commit
- python scripts, file operations
- [Add project-specific allowed commands]

## Ask Permission Commands (User Approval Required):
- [List commands that need permission]
- rm -rf, git reset --hard
- [Add project-specific ask commands]

## Denied Commands (Blocked):
- [List blocked commands and why]
- Installation commands (if safe mode)
- Network operations (if local mode)
- [Add project-specific denied commands]
```

## Task Management System

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read `.claude/TASK-MANAGEMENT.md` for complete task management instructions.**

### Session Startup Procedure (CRITICAL)
**At the start of EVERY conversation, Claude must:**
1. **Read TODO.md** immediately to check for "In Progress" tasks
2. **Identify active work** from the "üìã Current Tasks (In Progress)" section  
3. **Prioritize these tasks** as the next work to be done
4. **Resume work** on these tasks unless user explicitly requests something else
5. **Update task status** as work progresses

### Task Commands:
- **"scan the tasks"** - Check GitHub Project, fetch tasks, present organized by status/priority
- **"show todo"** - Display complete TODO.md with status summary

### File Usage:
- **TODO.md** - Persistent task tracking (survives session restarts)
- **TodoWrite tool** - Temporary session-based todos
- **.claude/TASK-MANAGEMENT.md** - Complete workflow documentation

## Development Workflow System

**‚ö†Ô∏è Read `.claude/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md` for complete development workflow.**

### Automatic Setup for Tasks
When user selects a task from "scan the tasks", Claude automatically:
1. **Creates GitHub issue** with proper labels and assignment
2. **Creates feature branch** with standardized naming
3. **Sets up work folder** (`work/issue-{number}/`) with README, NOTES, tests, docs
4. **Creates draft PR** linked to the issue

### Development Commands:
- **"git push"** - Intelligent branch detection and push
- **"make production"** / **"merge code"** - Complete merge and cleanup workflow
- **"start working on issue #123"** - Full setup workflow
- **"create hotfix"** - Emergency bug fix workflow

### Directory Structure:
```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work/                    # Development workspace
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ issue-123/          # Issue-specific folder
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Task details and checklist
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NOTES.md        # Development notes
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Issue-specific tests
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # Issue documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # Main project source
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                  # Main project tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                   # Main project docs
```
