# Remote Installation System Documentation

## üöÄ Overview

This document describes the comprehensive remote installation system for deploying projects and third-party software to remote servers via MCP SSH connections. The system supports two main workflows:

1. **Project Installation**: `install remotely` - Deploy this project to a remote server
2. **Software Installation**: `remote install [software]` - Install third-party software on a remote server

## üìã System Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Remote server accessible via MCP SSH connection
- User account with sudo access (no password required)
- Git installed on remote server (will be installed if missing)
- Internet connectivity on remote server

### MCP Server Configuration
The system requires configured MCP SSH servers as documented in `.claude/README-LOCAL-MCP-SERVER.md`:
- **dev-docker**: Port 3001 (192.168.69.23)
- **ssh-mcp**: Port 3002 (192.168.69.24) 
- **suitecrm**: Port 3003 (192.168.69.25)
- **api-server**: Port 3004 (api.alistairhenderson.support)

4. User responds: e.g., "developer"
5. Claude performs git push to origin
6. Claude connects to specified MCP server
7. Installation process begins following the project workflow

### Remote Install Software

**Command**: `remote install [software-name]`

**Example**: `remote install SuiteCRM`

**Workflow**:
1. Claude prompts: "Which MCP server should I use for SuiteCRM installation?"
2. User responds: e.g., "suitecrm"
3. Claude prompts: "Which user should I use? (Must have sudo access with no password required)"
4. User responds: e.g., "crmadmin"
5. Claude connects to specified MCP server
6. Software installation process begins following vendor instructions
